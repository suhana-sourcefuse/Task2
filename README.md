# Task 2: Bank Transaction Summary

This Python script collects user input for:
- **Name** of the user
- **Starting balance**
- A list of **transactions** (amount and type: credit/debit)

It then:
- Stores the data in **variables** and a **list of lists** for transactions.
- **Prints a transaction summary**, showing each transaction and the final balance after all transactions.
- **Calculates the final balance** based on the transactions (credit increases balance, debit decreases it).

### To Run:
```bash
python bank_transaction_summary.py
